    <h1>Week 1</h1>
    <h3>Individual Accomplishments:</h3>
    <p> Most of my work this week was directed towards establishing a styling template for our React application that will allow for a fluid user experience. In order to allow for an easily manages styles library, I installed less into our project and included separate files for variables, and mixins. When applying these styled to our various components, we came to an agreement on a structure for each webpage and applied that to all the components we built. My Components contribution include the header, footer, navigation icon, and jumbotron (located on the landing page).</p>
    <p> In addition to working on the Front-End, I took some time this week in order to learn about the GraphQL Yoga database. After reviewing how my fellow team members built out their end points, I assisted in getting our database deployed.</p>
    <p>The following lists my contributions to the project:</p>
